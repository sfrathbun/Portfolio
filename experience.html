									<h3>Data Security Integration and Remediation | February 2024 - Present</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									As the Director of Product Delivery, I led a comprehensive data discovery project focused on integrating and leveraging
									Azure Information Protection (AIP) file scan results. I worked directly with our customer to plan, build, and oversee the development of an integration that pulls in detailed
									file-level data and identifies files requiring remediation by tagging sensitive information types detected by AIP, including Credit Card numbers and PII data.
									Building on this foundation, I designed and implemented a remediation program that generates automated notifications and
									tickets for end users to clean up files on their corporate endpoints. Additionally, I established a structured support process,
									ensuring our support team could guide end users and property teams in effectively remediating files within scope.
									I was actively involved throughout the project lifecycle, from initial integration development to implementing the remediation
									workflow and defining the support processes that guarantee successful adoption and compliance.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Integrations</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>Microsoft Azure Information Protection - Pulling data directly from on-prem database servers.</li>
									<li>C# - Data parsing and email notification program.</li>
									<li>ServiceNow API integration - Created tickets to track and manage the remediation workflow. </li>
									<li>Endpoint Security Compliance Tool - Generated reports and dashboards showing remediation progress</li>
								</ul>
								<header>
									<h3>My contributions to this project</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>Conducted daily stand-up meetings with the customer to collaboratively develop the remediation plan and oversee the project lifecycle from initiation to completion.</li>
									<li>
										Developed PowerPoint and Visio presentations to effectively communicate project progress and milestones to leadership.
										Additionally, these materials visually documented the full integration workflow, helping stakeholders quickly understand
										the process and technical approach.
									</li>
									<li>
										Collaborated with the customer to define the support process, develop comprehensive documentation and FAQs,
										and train the support team to effectively guide end users through issue remediation.
									</li>
									<li>
										During a three-week pilot, we identified over 11,000 files containing credit card numbers. Following the pilot,
										all files were successfully remediated, with our support team actively assisting end users to ensure proper remediation and compliance.

									<h3>Franchise Managed Detection & Response Compliance and Support | May 2022 - Present</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This project addresses the growing security challenges faced by enterprise organizations operating under franchise models by
									standardizing endpoint protection across all properties. By implementing endpoint security, EDR, and a 24/7 MDR solution,
									the initiative protects devices, guest data, and customer PII while reducing the risk of high-impact ransomware attacks.
								</p>
								<p>
									The solution includes a compliance notification system and a ServiceNow API integration to collect proof of compliance at scale.
									A dedicated support team works directly with franchise properties to ensure approved security controls are deployed consistently,
									helping maintain compliance and strengthen the organization’s overall security posture.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Integrations</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>CrowdStrike API integration - Routine data ingestion to prove compliance per location as well as pulling in unmanaged devices to ensure all in-scope devices are protected.</li>
									<li>ServiceNow API integration - Created tickets to track and manage the remediation workflow.</li>
									<li>C# - Compliance checking and email notification program.</li>
									<li>Microsoft SharePoint - Routine file transfers to SharePoint site for PowerBi creation.</li>
									<li>SFTP File Transfer - Daily file transfers to track compliance for enterprise.</li>
									<li>Endpoint Security Compliance Tool - Generated reports and dashboards showing remediation progress on a continent level.</li>

									<h3>Splunk Web Server Logging and Compliance | November 2023 - Present</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I led the design and implementation of an enterprise web server logging compliance initiative to ensure all hosts running
									web servers centrally log both access and error events to Splunk. The solution automatically discovers active web servers
									across Windows and Linux environments, validates that logging is functioning as expected, and measures compliance by
									generating and verifying real log activity. Confirmed log data is ingested into a centralized database, enabling accurate
									reporting and visibility into logging compliance across the enterprise.
								</p>
								<p>
									This effort required close collaboration with multiple application and infrastructure teams to support a wide range of server
									types and web technologies, including both property and above-property systems. I also partnered with the support organization
									to establish operational processes for follow-up and remediation, ensuring application owners address gaps and maintain continuous
									compliance with logging requirements.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Integrations</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>Shell scripting - Custom Splunk Technical Add-On (TA) to identify running web servers and their active listening ports. Local web server probing to intentionally generate access and error logs for validation</li>
									<li>C# - Splunk log verification to confirm successful ingestion of generated log events</li>
									<li>Compliance data ingestion into an internal database for reporting and metrics</li>
									<li>PowerShell scripting - Windows host discovery scripts to detect active web servers locally.</li>
									<li>Remote IIS probing to validate IIS access and error logs are correctly forwarded to Splunk.</li>
									<li>Multi-platform support for both Linux and Windows web servers across diverse environments</li>
									<li>Operational support workflows to track non-compliant systems and coordinate remediation with application owners.</li>
								</ul>

									<h2>Data Platform Reliability and Performance</h2>
								</header>
								<img src="images/database-monitoring.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;" class="image fit" />
								<br />
								<br />
								<p>
									I lead ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability, scalability, and performance of our enterprise data platform,
									which supports over 100 API integrations and programs which ingests over 100 million rows of data daily.
									The platform sustains billions of read and write operations each day, requiring deliberate design, continuous monitoring,
									and proactive optimization to maintain consistent performance at scale.
								</p>
								<p>
									To address throughput and stability challenges, I re-architected data ingestion workflows by implementing controlled batch
									and file chunking strategies, significantly reducing I/O contention and improving load predictability during high-volume
									data processing. I also tuned MySQL database configurations and storage-level I/O parameters, along with other critical
									global settings, to better align the database engine with real-world workload demands. In parallel, I established standards
									and review practices to ensure application queries are efficient, non-blocking, and free of excessive locking behaviors that
									could degrade concurrent operations. Collectively, these efforts have strengthened platform resiliency, improved responsiveness,
									and positioned the data platform to scale reliably as usage and data volumes continue to grow.
