											<h2>Hi, I’m Sean Rathbun</h2>
											<br />
											<p>
												For over five years, I’ve built secure, scalable software, partnering directly with Governance, Risk, 
												and Compliance and Endpoint Compliance teams to take complex systems from idea to production.
											</p>

									<section>
										<p><b>About Me</b></p>
										<p>
											Currently serving as Director of Project Delivery, with 5+ years of experience as a Security Engineer, I focus on building
											and operating backend systems, enterprise platforms, and forward-deployed solutions within security and compliance-driven environments.
											My work spans software development, system reliability, and hands-on problem solving in complex, real-world scenarios.
										</p>
										<p>
											Technology, software development, and project execution have always been core passions of mine. I am deeply motivated by solving
											complex problems and guiding initiatives from initial concept through successful delivery. I believe the strongest outcomes are
											achieved through collaboration—by working closely with diverse teams, sharing ideas openly, and leveraging collective strengths
											to accomplish goals greater than any one individual could achieve alone. I am equally passionate about helping build and grow
											organizations by continuously improving systems, processes, and tooling, and by thoughtfully raising the bar on quality, performance,
											and innovation. Seeing tangible progress and sustainable growth is what energizes me most about the work I do.
										</p>
										<p>
											Outside of my professional life, I place a high value on time spent with my family—especially my wife and our three young boys.
											We enjoy being outdoors together, whether that’s hiking, fishing, exploring the mountains, mountain biking, BMX riding, or seeking
											out new experiences that bring a sense of adventure. I’m always eager to take on new hobbies and challenges, fully committing myself
											to learning and growth. I believe in making the most of the life we’ve been given, embracing both meaningful work and memorable
											experiences along the way.
										</p>

										Sean is a very fast learner and is detail oriented. Sean has the ability to quickly study topics and gain an in-depth understanding
										which he can apply. This results in high quality work getting done optimally and quickly. Sean does very high quality work relatively
										quickly. If there is a task he is not experienced in, he does not hesitate to jump in and start researching, studying and learning.

										Sean is an all-star who was effective in his role as a student. He would come ready to learn and grow and I watched as he would tackle
										giants in his life. I was always impressed with how he would choose honor and love while working with employers and executives. And
										he would discuss challenges in our mentor/mentee meetings. Sean is a family man who takes pride in being a husband, father, and Christ-follower.
										His beliefs and values will continue to shape and mold him. And I believe his character to show love wherever he goes will be a dynamic gift
										and asset when he is apart of tech teams in his future. -Zach Knopes
